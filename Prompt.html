    Are you a working parent? 
    Do you have an infant or a toddler who loves to listen to stories?
    Are the same old stories boring him? 
    Is it racking your brain to come up with new stories almost everyday? 
    If you answered yes to any one of the above questions, you have come to the right place.
    
    Welcome to SmartParent, a place where you will no longer feel the need to innovate, at least in the story department (shhh.. don't tell you kids!!)
